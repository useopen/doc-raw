== Application servers and environments supported by Weld

=== Using Weld with WildFly

If you are using WildFly 8.0 or better, no additional configuration is
required to use Weld (or CDI for that matter).

=== GlassFish

Weld is also built into GlassFish from V3 onwards. Since GlassFish V3 is
the Java EE 6 reference implementation, it must support all features of
CDI. What better way for GlassFish to support these features than to use
Weld, the CDI reference implementation? Just package up your CDI
application and deploy.

=== Servlet containers (such as Tomcat or Jetty)

While CDI does not require support for servlet environments, Weld can be
used in a servlet container, such as Tomcat or Jetty.

NOTE: There is a major limitation to using a servlet container. Weld doesn't
support deploying session beans, injection using `@EJB`
or`@PersistenceContext`, or using transactional events in servlet
containers. For enterprise features such as these, you should really be
looking at a Java EE application server.

Weld can be used as a library in an web application that is deployed to
a Servlet container. You should place `weld-servlet.jar` within the
`WEB-INF/lib` directory relative to the web root. `weld-servlet.jar` is
an "uber-jar", meaning it bundles all the bits of Weld and CDI required
for running in a Servlet container, for your convenience. Alternatively,
you can use its component jars. A list of transitive dependencies can be
found in the `META-INF/DEPENDENCIES.txt` file inside the
`weld-servlet.jar` artifact.

You also need to explicitly specify the servlet listener (used to boot
Weld, and control its interaction with requests) in WEB-INF/web.xml in
the web root:

[source.XML, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<listener>
   <listener-class>org.jboss.weld.environment.servlet.Listener</listener-class>
</listener>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually, you don't have to register this listener in Servlet 3.x
compliant containers which support
`javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` service properly (e.g.
Tomcat 7.0.50). In this case
`org.jboss.weld.environment.servlet.EnhancedListener` will do all the
necessary work automatically, and what is more important - injection
into Listeners will work on some containers as well (see <<_tomcat>> and <<_jetty>> for
more info).

The downside of `javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` approach is
that the Weld listener will be added to the end of the ordered list of
discovered listeners. In practice the request and session context will
not be active during `ServletRequestListener` and `HttpSessionListener`
notifications. Fortunately, it's possible to combine the
`EnhancedListener` and the old `Listener` to fix this problem - simply
add the old `Listener` to the `web.xml` as mentioned above. Note that it
must be defined before the listeners using request and session context.

NOTE: There is quite a special use-case where one more special component must
be involved. If you want the session context to be active during
`HttpSessionListener.sessionDestroyed()` invocation when the session
times out or when all the sessions are destroyed because the deployment
is being removed then `org.jboss.weld.servlet.WeldTerminalListener` must
be specified as the last one in your `web.xml`. This listener activates
the session context before other listeners are invoked (note that the
listeners are notified in reverse order when a session is being
destroyed).

==== Tomcat

Since version 2.2.0.Final only Tomcat 7 and 8 are supported.

Tomcat has a read-only JNDI, so Weld can't automatically bind the
BeanManager extension SPI. To bind the BeanManager into JNDI, you should
populate `META-INF/context.xml` in the web root with the following
contents:

[source.XML, xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------
<Context>
   <Resource name="BeanManager"
      auth="Container"
      type="javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager"
      factory="org.jboss.weld.resources.ManagerObjectFactory"/>
</Context>
---------------------------------------------------------------

and make it available to your deployment by adding this to the bottom
of `web.xml`:

[source.XML, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------
<resource-env-ref>
   <resource-env-ref-name>BeanManager</resource-env-ref-name>
   <resource-env-ref-type>
      javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager
   </resource-env-ref-type>
</resource-env-ref>
-------------------------------------------------------------

Tomcat only allows you to bind entries to `java:comp/env`, so the
BeanManager will be available at `java:comp/env/BeanManager`

Weld also supports Servlet and Filter injection in Tomcat containers.
Listener injection should also work on Tomcat 7.0.50 and newer versions.

==== Jetty

Since version 2.0.2.Final only Jetty 7, 8 and 9 are supported.

To bind the BeanManager into JNDI, you should either populate
`WEB-INF/jetty-env.xml` with the following contents:

[source.XML, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Mort Bay Consulting//DTD Configure//EN"
   "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure.dtd">

<Configure id="webAppCtx" class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
    <New id="BeanManager" class="org.eclipse.jetty.plus.jndi.Resource">
        <Arg> <Ref id="webAppCtx"/> </Arg>
        <Arg>BeanManager</Arg>
        <Arg>
            <New class="javax.naming.Reference">
                <Arg>javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager</Arg>
                <Arg>org.jboss.weld.resources.ManagerObjectFactory</Arg>
                <Arg/>
            </New>
        </Arg>
    </New>
</Configure>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or you can configure a special Servlet listener to bind the BeanManager
automatically:

[source.XML, xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<listener>
   <listener-class>org.jboss.weld.environment.servlet.BeanManagerResourceBindingListener</listener-class>
</listener>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just like in Tomcat, you need to make the BeanManager available to your
deployment by adding this to the bottom of `web.xml`:

[source.XML, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------
<resource-env-ref>
   <resource-env-ref-name>BeanManager</resource-env-ref-name>
   <resource-env-ref-type>
      javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager
   </resource-env-ref-type>
</resource-env-ref>
-------------------------------------------------------------

Jetty only allows you to bind entries to `java:comp/env`, so the
BeanManager will be available at `java:comp/env/BeanManager`.

Since Jetty 8 the class `org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler.Decorator` is not visible from the web application.
Therefore, one more step is required - we have to tell Jetty not to hide this system class.  

Simply place the following `jetty-context.xml` file in the WEB-INF dir:

[source.XML, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure.dtd">
<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
    <Set name="serverClasses">
        <Array type="java.lang.String">
            <Item>-org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler.Decorator</Item>
        </Array>
    </Set>
</Configure>
-------------------------------------------------------------

See also http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/jetty-classloading.html#setting-server-classes[Jetty Classloading documentation].

Weld also supports Servlet and Filter injection in Jetty containers.
Listener injection should also work on Jetty 9.1.1 and newer versions.

==== Bean Archive Isolation

By default, bean archive isolation is enabled. It means that alternatives, interceptors and decorators can be selected/enabled for a bean archive by using a beans.xml descriptor.

This behaviour can be changed by setting the servlet initialization parameter `org.jboss.weld.environment.servlet.archive.isolation` to false.
In this case, Weld will use a "flat" deployment structure - all bean classes share the same bean archive and all beans.xml descriptors are automatically merged into one. Thus alternatives, interceptors and decorators selected/enabled for a bean archive will be enabled for the whole application.

NOTE: Bean archive isolation is supported (and enabled by default) from version 2.2.5.Final. Previous versions only operated with the "flat" deployment structure.   

==== Implicit Bean Archive Support

CDI 1.1 introduced the bean discovery mode of `annotated` used for implicit bean archives (see also <<packaging-and-deployment>>). 
This mode may bring additional overhead during container bootstrap. Therefore, Weld Servlet supports the use of https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex] bytecode scanning library to speed up the scanning process. Simply put the http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22org.jboss%22%20AND%20a%3A%22jandex%22[jandex.jar] on the classpath. 
If Jandex is not found on the classpath Weld will use the Java Reflection as a fallback.

In general, an implicit bean archive does not have to contain a beans.xml descriptor. However, such a bean archive is not supported by Weld Servlet, i.e. it's excluded from discovery.  

NOTE: The bean discovery mode of `annotated` is supported from version 2.2.5.Final. Previous versions processed implicit bean archives in the same way as explicit bean archives.

=== Java SE

In addition to improved integration of the Enterprise Java stack, the
"Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
specification also defines a state of the art typesafe, stateful
dependency injection framework, which can prove useful in a wide range
of application types. To help developers take advantage of this, Weld
provides a simple means for being executed in the Java Standard Edition
(SE) environment independently of any Java EE APIs.

When executing in the SE environment the following features of Weld are
available:

* Managed beans with `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` lifecycle
callbacks
* Dependency injection with qualifiers and alternatives
* `@Application`, `@Dependent` and `@Singleton` scopes
* Interceptors and decorators
* Stereotypes
* Events
* Portable extension support

EJB beans are not supported.

==== CDI SE Module

Weld provides an extension which will boot a CDI bean manager in Java
SE, automatically registering all simple beans found on the classpath.
The command line parameters can be injected using either of the
following:

[source.JAVA, java]
----------------------------------------
@Inject @Parameters List<String> params;
----------------------------------------

[source.JAVA, java]
-----------------------------------------
@Inject @Parameters String[] paramsArray;
-----------------------------------------

The second form is useful for compatibility with existing classes.

NOTE: The command line parameters do not become available for injection until
the `ContainerInitialized` event is fired. If you need access to the
parameters during initialization you can do so via the
`public static String[] getParameters()` method in `StartMain`.

Here's an example of a simple CDI SE application:

[source.JAVA, java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import javax.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
public class HelloWorld
{
   public void printHello(@Observes ContainerInitialized event, @Parameters List<String> parameters) {
       System.out.println("Hello " + parameters.get(0));
   }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Bootstrapping CDI SE

CDI SE applications can be bootstrapped in the following ways.

===== The `ContainerInitialized` Event

Thanks to the power of CDI's typesafe event model, application
developers need not write any bootstrapping code. The Weld SE module
comes with a built-in main method which will bootstrap CDI for you and
then fire a `ContainerInitialized` event. The entry point for your
application code would therefore be a simple bean which observes the
`ContainerInitialized` event, as in the previous example.

In this case your application can be started by calling the provided
main method like so:

[source.JAVA, java]
---------------------------------------------------
java org.jboss.weld.environment.se.StartMain <args>
---------------------------------------------------

===== Programmatic Bootstrap API

For added flexibility, CDI SE also comes with a bootstrap API which can
be called from within your application in order to initialize CDI and
obtain references to your application's beans and events. The API
consists of two classes: `Weld` and `WeldContainer`.

[source.JAVA, java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Weld
{

   /** Boots Weld and creates and returns a WeldContainer instance, through which
    * beans and events can be accesed. */
   public WeldContainer initialize() {...}

   /** Convenience method for shutting down the container. */
   public void shutdown() {...}

}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[source.JAVA, java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
public class WeldContainer
{

   /** Provides access to all beans within the application. */
   public Instance<Object> instance() {...}

   /** Provides access to all events within the application. */
   public Event<Object> event() {...}

   /** Provides direct access to the BeanManager. */
   public BeanManager getBeanManager() {...}

}
---------------------------------------------------------------

Here's an example application main method which uses this API to
initialize a bean of type `MyApplicationBean`.

[source.JAVA, java]
--------------------------------------------------------------
import org.jboss.weld.environment.se.Weld;

public static void main(String[] args) {
   Weld weld = new Weld();
   WeldContainer container = weld.initialize();
   container.instance().select(MyApplicationBean.class).get();
   weld.shutdown();
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively the application could be started by firing a custom event
which would then be observed by another simple bean. The following
example fires `MyEvent` on startup.

[source.JAVA, java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
org.jboss.weld.environment.se.Weld;

public static void main(String[] args) {
   Weld weld = new Weld();
   WeldContainer container = weld.initialize();
   container.event().select(MyEvent.class).fire( new MyEvent() );
   weld.shutdown();
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

==== Thread Context

In contrast to Java EE applications, Java SE applications place no
restrictions on developers regarding the creation and usage of threads.
Therefore Weld SE provides a custom scope annotation, `@ThreadScoped`,
and corresponding context implementation which can be used to bind bean
instances to the current thread. It is intended to be used in scenarios
where you might otherwise use `ThreadLocal`, and does in fact use
`ThreadLocal` under the hood.

To use the `@ThreadScoped` annotation you need to enable the
`RunnableDecorator` which 'listens' for all executions of
`Runnable.run()` and decorates them by setting up the thread context
beforehand, bound to the current thread, and destroying the context
afterwards.

[source.XML, xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<beans>
  <decorators>
     <class>org.jboss.weld.environment.se.threading.RunnableDecorator</class>
  </decorator>
</beans>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: It is not necessary to use `@ThreadScoped` in all multithreaded
applications. The thread context is not intended as a replacement for
defining your own application-specific contexts. It is generally only
useful in situations where you would otherwise have used `ThreadLocal`
directly, which are typically rare.

==== Setting the Classpath

Weld SE comes packaged as a 'shaded' jar which includes the CDI API,
Weld Core and all dependent classes bundled into a single jar. Therefore
the only Weld jar you need on the classpath, in addition to your
application's classes and dependent jars, is the Weld SE jar. If you are
working with a pure Java SE application you launch using `java`, this
may be simpler for you.

If you prefer to work with individual dependencies, then you can use the
`weld-core` jar which just contains the Weld SE classes. Of course in
this mode you will need to assemble the classpath yourself.

If you work with a dependency management solution such as Maven you can
declare a dependency such as:

[source.XML, xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.weld.se</groupId>
   <artifactId>weld-se</artifactId>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

==== Bean Archive Isolation

By default, bean archive isolation is enabled. It means that alternatives, interceptors and decorators can be selected/enabled for a bean archive by using a beans.xml descriptor.

This behaviour can be changed by providing a system property `org.jboss.weld.se.archive.isolation` with value of `false`. In this case, Weld will use a "flat" deployment structure - all bean classes share the same bean archive and all beans.xml descriptors are automatically merged into one. Thus alternatives, interceptors and decorators selected/enabled for a bean archive will be enabled for the whole application. 

NOTE: Bean archive isolation is supported (and enabled by default) from version 2.2.0.Final. Previous versions only operated with the "flat" deployment structure.   

==== Implicit Bean Archive Support

CDI 1.1 introduced the bean discovery mode of `annotated` used for implicit bean archives (see also <<packaging-and-deployment>>). This mode may bring additional overhead during container bootstrap. 
Therefore, Weld Servlet supports the use of https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex] bytecode scanning library to speed up the scanning process. Simply put the http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22org.jboss%22%20AND%20a%3A%22jandex%22[jandex.jar] on the classpath.
If Jandex is not found on the classpath Weld will use the Java Reflection as a fallback.  

In general, an implicit bean archive does not have to contain a beans.xml descriptor. However, such a bean archive is not supported by Weld SE, i.e. it's excluded from discovery.  

NOTE: The bean discovery mode of `annotated` is supported from version 2.2.0.Final. Previous versions processed implicit bean archives in the same way as explicit bean archives.

=== OSGi

Weld supports OSGi environment through Pax CDI. For more information on
using Weld in OSGi environment check
https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/PAXCDI/Pax+CDI[Pax CDI
documentation] . In addition, Weld comes with a sample application
called Paint which demonstrates how to use CDI with OSGi. Check
`examples/osgi/README.md` for more information.
