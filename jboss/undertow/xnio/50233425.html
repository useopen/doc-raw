    A message channel is a type of channel which supports individual framing of messages. Like stream channels, message channels come in half- and full-duplex variants, with additional subvariants for readable and writable half-duplex channels, known as <tt class=" ">MessageChannels</tt>, <tt class=" ">ReadableMessageChannels</tt>, and <tt class=" ">WritableMessageChannels</tt>.            </p>
                <p>
    Writing a message to a message channel will cause the exact message to be delivered to the remote reader; the size and division of messages is preserved.  This implies that when you receive a message, your buffer must be large enough to hold the entire message.  In some cases this may require careful planning; there is no general facility to probe a message size before you receive it.  If your receive buffer is not large enough to accommodate a whole message, the message will be truncated.            </p>
                <p>
    The UDP protocol is a special case of a message channel.  An unconnected UDP channel sends and receives not only a message payload but also address payloads.  Because of this, a plain message channel does not suffice as it only manages the payload itself.  For this case, there is a special <tt class=" ">MultipointMessageChannel</tt> type family, whose send and receive methods include arguments for source and destination address specification.  There is also the <tt class=" ">MulticastMessageChannel</tt> interface to allow for multi-point message channels which are multicast-capable.            </p>
