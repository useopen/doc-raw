    XNIO is a low-level I/O framework which provides an NIO-like channel-based abstraction with the introduction of callbacks, thread management, and advanced resource management capabilities.  This framework provides simplified access to much of the lowest levels of network and file I/O available through Java, making it easier to implement ultra-high-performance network clients and servers with superior scalability.            </p>
                <p>
    This is not a framework for beginners.  It is an advanced I/O mechanism designed for developers who are already intimately familiar with TCP/IP and operating system-level file and socket I/O mechanisms.  This audience will find that XNIO provides access to many powerful constructs which are very difficult to access or utilize effectively with raw NIO.            </p>
                <p>
    This framework also provides many useful utility capabilities around buffer and thread management, asynchronous task handling and execution, streams, combining blocking and non-blocking I/O, and more.            </p>
