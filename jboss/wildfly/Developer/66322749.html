            <p>
    Since WildFly 8,&nbsp;Class loading is considerably different to previous versions of JBoss AS. Class loading is based on the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/MODULES">JBoss Modules</a> project. Instead of the more familiar hierarchical class loading environment, WildFly's class loading is based on modules that have to define explicit dependencies on other modules. Deployments in WildFly&nbsp;are also modules, and do not have access to classes that are defined in jars in the application server unless an explicit dependency on those classes is defined.            </p>
        <div class="section-2"  id="66322749_ClassLoadinginWildFly-DeploymentModuleNames"  >
        <h2>Deployment Module Names</h2>
    
            <p>
    Module names for top level deployments follow the format <tt class=" ">deployment.myarchive.war</tt> while sub deployments are named like <tt class=" ">deployment.myear.ear.mywar.war</tt>.&nbsp;            </p>
                <p>
    This means that it is possible for a deployment to import classes from another deployment using the other deployments module name, the details of how to add an explicit module dependency are explained below.            </p>
        </div>
    
    <div class="section-2"  id="66322749_ClassLoadinginWildFly-AutomaticDependencies"  >
        <h2>Automatic Dependencies</h2>
    
            <p>
    Even though in WildFly&nbsp;modules are isolated by default, as part of the deployment process some dependencies on modules defined by the application server are set up for you automatically. For instance, if you are deploying a Java EE application a dependency on the Java EE API's will be added to your module automatically. Similarly if your module contains a beans.xml file a dependency on <a href="http://seamframework.org/Weld">Weld </a>will be added automatically, along with any supporting modules that weld needs to operate.            </p>
                <p>
    For a complete list of the automatic dependencies that are added, please see <a href="66322752.html">Implicit module dependencies for deployments</a>.            </p>
                <p>
    Automatic dependencies can be excluded through the use of <tt class=" ">jboss-deployment-structure.xml</tt>.            </p>

        <h2>Class Loading&#160;Precedence</h2>
    
            <p>
    A common source of errors in Java applications is including API classes in a deployment that are also provided by the container. This can result in multiple versions of the class being created and the deployment failing to deploy properly. To prevent this in WildFly, module dependencies are added in a specific order that should prevent this situation from occurring.&nbsp;            </p>
                <p>
    In order of highest priority to lowest priority            </p>
    <ol class=" "><li class=" ">            <p>
    System Dependencies - These are dependencies that are added to the module automatically by the container, including the Java EE api's.            </p>
    </li><li class=" ">            <p>
    User Dependencies - These are dependencies that are added through&nbsp;<tt class=" ">jboss-deployment-structure.xml</tt>&nbsp;or through the&nbsp;<tt class=" ">Dependencies:</tt>&nbsp;manifest entry.            </p>

    </li><li class=" ">            <p>

    <div class="section-2"  id="66322749_ClassLoadinginWildFly-WARClassLoading"  >
        <h2>WAR Class Loading</h2>
    
            <p>
    The war is considered to be a single module, so classes defined in <tt class=" ">WEB-INF/lib</tt> are treated the same as classes in <tt class=" ">WEB-INF/classes</tt>. All classes packaged in the war will be loaded with the same class loader.            </p>
        </div>
    
    <div class="section-2"  id="66322749_ClassLoadinginWildFly-EARClassLoading"  >
        <h2>EAR Class Loading</h2>
    
            <p>
    Ear deployments are multi-module deployments. This means that not all classes inside an ear will necessarily have access to all other classes in the ear, unless explicit dependencies have been defined. By default the <tt class=" ">EAR/lib</tt> directory is a single module, and every WAR or EJB jar deployment is also a separate module. Sub deployments (wars and ejb-jars) always have a dependency on the parent module, which gives them access to classes in <tt class=" ">EAR/lib</tt>, however they do not always have an automatic dependency on each other. This behaviour is controlled via the <tt class=" ">ear-subdeployments-isolated</tt>&nbsp;setting in the ee subsystem configuration:&nbsp;            </p>
        <div class="confbox programlisting">
                <div class="content">
        <pre><code>&lt;subsystem xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:domain:ee:1.0&quot; &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
  &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;false&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;
&lt;/subsystem&gt;</code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
            <p>
    By default this is set to false, which allows the sub-deployments to see classes belonging to other sub-deployments within the .ear.            </p>
                <p>
    For example, consider the following .ear deployment:            </p>
        <div class="confbox programlisting">
                <div class="content">
        <pre><code>myapp.ear
 |
 |--- web.war
 |
 |--- ejb1.jar
 |
 |--- ejb2.jar</code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
            <p>
    If the ear-subdeployments-isolated is set to false, then the classes in web.war can access classes belonging to ejb1.jar and ejb2.jar. Similarly, classes from ejb1.jar can access classes from ejb2.jar (and vice-versa).            </p>
        <div class="confbox admonition admonition-note">
        
            <p>
    The ear-subdeployments-isolated element value has no effect on the isolated classloader of the .war file(s). i.e. irrespective of whether this flag is set to true or false, the .war within a .ear will have a isolated classloader and other sub-deployments within that .ear will not be able to access classes from that .war. This is as per spec.            </p>
        </div>
    
            <p>
    If the ear-subdeployments-isolated is set to true then no automatic module dependencies between the sub-deployments are set up. User must manually setup the dependency with <tt class=" ">Class-Path</tt> entries, or by setting up explicit module dependencies.            </p>
        <div class="confbox admonition admonition-tip">
            <div class="title">Portability</div>
        
            <p>
    The  Java EE specification says that portable applications should not rely  on sub deployments having access to other sub deployments unless an  explicit Class-Path entry is set in the MANIFEST.MF. So portable  applications should always use Class-Path entry to explicitly state  their dependencies.            </p>
        </div>
    
    <div class="confbox admonition admonition-info">
        
            <p>
    It is also possible to override the ear-subdeployments-isolated element value at a per deployment level. See the section on jboss-deployment-structure.xml below.            </p>
        </div>
    
            <p>
    <tt class=" ">Dependencies:</tt><strong class=" ">&nbsp;Manifest Entries</strong>            </p>
                <p>
    Deployments (or more correctly modules within a deployment) may set up dependencies on other modules by adding a <tt class=" ">Dependencies:</tt> manifest entry. This entry consists of a comma separated list of module names that the deployment requires. The&nbsp;available&nbsp;modules can be seen under the <tt class=" ">modules</tt> directory in the application server distribution. For example to add a dependency on javassist and apache velocity you can add a manifest entry as follows:            </p>
                <p>
    <tt class=" ">Dependencies: org.javassist export,org.apache.velocity export services,org.antlr</tt>            </p>
                <p>
    Each dependency entry may also specify some of the following parameters by adding them after the module name:            </p>
    <ul class=" "><li class=" ">            <p>
    <tt class=" ">export</tt> This means that the dependencies will be exported, so any module that depends on this module will also get access to the dependency.            </p>
    </li><li class=" ">            <p>
    <tt class=" ">services</tt> By default items in META-INF of a dependency are not accessible, this makes items from <tt class=" ">META-INF/services</tt> accessible so <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">services </a> in the modules can be loaded.            </p>
    </li><li class=" ">            <p>
    <tt class=" ">optional</tt> If this is specified the deployment will not fail if the module is not available.            </p>
    </li><li class=" ">            <p>
    <tt class=" ">meta-inf</tt> This will make the contents of the <tt class=" ">META-INF</tt> directory available (unlike <tt class=" ">services</tt>, which just makes <tt class=" ">META-INF/services</tt> available). In general this will not cause any deployment descriptors in META-INF to be processed, with the exception of <tt class=" ">beans.xml</tt>. If a <tt class=" ">beans.xml</tt> file is present this module will be scanned by Weld and any resulting beans will be available to the application.            </p>
    </li><li class=" ">            <p>
    <tt class=" ">annotations</tt> If a jandex index has be created for the module these annotations will be merged into the deployments annotation index. The <a href="https://github.com/jbossas/jandex">Jandex</a> index can be generated using the <a href="https://github.com/jbossas/jandex/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/jandex/JandexAntTask.java">Jandex ant task </a>, and must be named <tt class=" ">META-INF/jandex.idx</tt>. Note that it is not necessary to break open the jar being indexed to add this to the modules class path, a better approach is to create a jar containing just this index, and adding it as an additional resource root in the <tt class=" ">module.xml</tt> file.            </p>

    Using the <tt class=" ">export</tt> parameter it is possible to add a dependency to all sub deployments in an ear. If a module is exported from a <tt class=" ">Dependencies:</tt> entry in the top level of the ear (or by a jar in the <tt class=" ">ear/lib</tt> directory) it will be available to all sub deployments as well.            </p>

    It is also possible to add module&nbsp;dependencies&nbsp;on other modules inside the deployment using the <tt class=" ">Class-Path</tt> manifest entry.

If a jar in the <tt class=" ">EAR/lib</tt> directory references a jar via <tt class=" ">Class-Path:</tt> then this additional jar is merged into the parent ear's module, and is accessible to all sub deployments in the ear.&nbsp;            </p>

    <tt class=" ">jboss-deployment-structure.xml</tt> is a JBoss specific deployment descriptor that can be used to control class loading in a fine grained manner.
