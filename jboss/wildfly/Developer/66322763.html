            <p>
    The applications in this section were written for a previous version of the server but have been modified to run on WildFly 8. Changes were made to resolve issues that arose during deployment and runtime or to fix problems with application behaviour. Each example below documents the changes that were made to get the application to run successfully on WildFly.            </p>

            <p>
    This document takes a somewhat different &quot;brute force&quot; approach. The idea is to deploy the binaries to WildFly, then see what issues you hit and learn how debug and resolve them.

        <h2>Example Applications Based on EE6</h2>
    
            <p>
    Applications in this section were designed and written specifically to use the features and functions of EE6.            </p>
    <ul class=" "><li class=" ">            <p>
    Quickstarts: A number of quickstart applications were written to demonstrate Java EE 6 and a few additional technologies. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project. For more information about the quickstarts, see <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/guide/Introduction/">Get Started Developing Applications </a>            </p>
