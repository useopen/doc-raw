    <title>High Availability and Failover</title>

    <para>We define high availability as the <emphasis>ability for the system to continue
       functioning after failure of one or more of the servers</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>A part of high availability is <emphasis>failover</emphasis> which we define as the
       <emphasis>ability for client connections to migrate from one server to another in event of
          server failure so client applications can continue to operate</emphasis>.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Live - Backup Groups</title>

        <para>HornetQ allows servers to be linked together as <emphasis>live - backup</emphasis>
           groups where each live server can have 1 or more backup servers. A backup server is owned by
           only one live server.  Backup servers are not operational until failover occurs, however 1
           chosen backup, which will be in passive mode, announces its status and waits to take over
           the live servers work</para>

        <para>Before failover, only the live server is serving the HornetQ clients while the backup
           servers remain passive or awaiting to become a backup server. When a live server crashes or
           is brought down in the correct mode, the backup server currently in passive mode will become
           live and another backup server will become passive. If a live server restarts after a
           failover then it will have priority and be the next server to become live when the current
           live server goes down, if the current live server is configured to allow automatic failback
           then it will detect the live server coming back up and automatically stop.</para>

        <section id="ha.policies">
            <title>HA Policies</title>
            <para>HornetQ supports two different strategies for backing up a server <emphasis>shared
               store</emphasis> and <emphasis>replication</emphasis>. Which is configured via the
               <literal>ha-policy</literal> configuration element.</para>

           <para>
              As well as these 2 strategies there is also a 3rd called <literal>live-only</literal>. This of course means there
              will be no Backup Strategy and is the default if none is provided, however this is used to configure
              <literal>scale-down</literal> which we will cover in a later chapter.

           <note>
              <para>
                 The <literal>ha-policy</literal> configurations replaces any current HA configuration in the root of the
                 <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> configuration. All old configuration is now deprecated altho
                 best efforts will be made to honour it if configured this way.

                <para>Only persistent message data will survive failover. Any non persistent message
                   data will not be available after failover.</para>

           <para>The <literal>ha-policy</literal> type configures which strategy a cluster should use to provide the
              backing up of a servers data. Within this configuration element is configured how a server should behave
              within the cluster, either as a master (live), slave (backup) or colocated (both live and backup). This
              would look something like: </para>

            <title>Data Replication</title>
            <para>Support for network-based data replication was added in version 2.3.</para>
            <para>When using replication, the live and the backup servers do not share the same
               data directories, all data synchronization is done over the network. Therefore all (persistent)
               data received by the live server will be duplicated to the backup.</para>
            <graphic fileref="images/ha-replicated-store.png" align="center"/>
            <para>Notice that upon start-up the backup server will first need to synchronize all
               existing data from the live server before becoming capable of replacing the live
               server should it fail. So unlike when using shared storage, a replicating backup will
               not be a fully operational backup right after start-up, but only after it finishes
               synchronizing the data with its live server. The time it will take for this to happen
               will depend on the amount of data to be synchronized and the connection speed.</para>

            <note>
                <para>Synchronization occurs in parallel with current network traffic so this won't cause any
                  blocking on current clients.</para>
            </note>
            <para>Replication will create a copy of the data at the backup. One issue to be aware
               of is: in case of a successful fail-over, the backup's data will be newer than
               the one at the live's storage. If you configure your live server to perform a
               <xref linkend="ha.allow-fail-back">'fail-back'</xref> when restarted, it will synchronize
               its data with the backup's. If both servers are shutdown, the administrator will have
               to determine which one has the latest data.</para>

            <para>The replicating live and backup pair must be part of a cluster.  The Cluster
               Connection also defines how backup servers will find the remote live servers to pair
               with.  Refer to <xref linkend="clusters"/> for details on how this is done, and how
               to configure a cluster connection. Notice that:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Both live and backup servers must be part of the same cluster.  Notice
                       that even a simple live/backup replicating pair will require a cluster configuration.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Their cluster user and password must match.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>Within a cluster, there are two ways that a backup server will locate a live server to replicate
               from, these are:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>specifying a node group</literal>. You can specify a group of live servers that a backup
                       server can connect to. This is done by configuring <literal>group-name</literal> in either the <literal>master</literal>
                       or the <literal>slave</literal> element of the
                       <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. A Backup server will only connect to a live server that
                       shares the same node group name</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                   <para><literal>connecting to any live</literal>. This will be the behaviour if <literal>group-name</literal>
                      is not configured allowing a backup server to connect to any live server</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <note>

                   servers:</para>

                </itemizedlist>
                <para>After joining the cluster the backups with <literal>group-name=fish</literal> will
                   search for live servers with <literal>group-name=fish</literal> to pair with. Since there
                   is one backup too many, the <literal>fish</literal> will remain with one spare backup.</para>
                <para>The 2 backups with <literal>group-name=bird</literal> (<literal>backup5</literal> and
                   <literal>backup6</literal>) will pair with live servers <literal>live4</literal> and
                   <literal>live5</literal>.</para>
            </note>
            <para>The backup will search for any live server that it is configured to connect to. It then tries to
               replicate with each live server in turn until it finds a live server that has no current backup
               configured. If no live server is available it will wait until the cluster topology changes and
               repeats the process.</para>
            <note>
               <para>This is an important distinction from a shared-store backup, if a backup starts and does not find
                  a live server, the server will just activate and start to serve client requests.
                  In the replication case, the backup just keeps
                  waiting for a live server to pair with. Note that in replication the backup server
                  does not know whether any data it might have is up to date, so it really cannot
                  decide to activate automatically. To activate a replicating backup server using the data
                  it has, the administrator must change its configuration to make it a live server by changing
                  <literal>slave</literal> to <literal>master</literal>.</para>
            </note>

            <para>Much like in the shared-store case, when the live server stops or crashes,
               its replicating backup will become active and take over its duties. Specifically,
               the backup will become active when it loses connection to its live server. This can
               be problematic because this can also happen because of a temporary network
               problem. In order to address this issue, the backup will try to determine whether it
               still can connect to the other servers in the cluster. If it can connect to more
               than half the servers, it will become active, if more than half the servers also
               disappeared with the live, the backup will wait and try reconnecting with the live.
               This avoids a split brain situation.</para>

            <para>When using a shared store, both live and backup servers share the
               <emphasis>same</emphasis> entire data directory using a shared file system.
               This means the paging directory, journal directory, large messages and binding
               journal.</para>
            <para>When failover occurs and a backup server takes over, it will load the
               persistent storage from the shared file system and clients can connect to
               it.</para>
            <para>This style of high availability differs from data replication in that it
               requires a shared file system which is accessible by both the live and backup
               nodes. Typically this will be some kind of high performance Storage Area Network
               (SAN). We do not recommend you use Network Attached Storage (NAS), e.g. NFS
               mounts to store any shared journal (NFS is slow).</para>
            <para>The advantage of shared-store high availability is that no replication occurs
               between the live and backup nodes, this means it does not suffer any performance
               penalties due to the overhead of replication during normal operation.</para>
            <para>The disadvantage of shared store replication is that it requires a shared file
               system, and when the backup server activates it needs to load the journal from
               the shared store which can take some time depending on the amount of data in the
               store.</para>
            <para>If you require the highest performance during normal operation, have access to
               a fast SAN and live with a slightly slower failover (depending on amount of
               data).</para>

              a live server will first search the cluster for another server using its nodeID. If it finds one, it will

              will have to synchronize its data with the server running with its ID, once they are in sync, it will
              request the other server (which it assumes it is a back that has assumed its duties) to shutdown for it to
              take over. This is necessary because otherwise the live server has no means to know whether there was a

            <para>It is also possible when running standalone to colocate backup servers in the same

                to start a backup server in the same JVM either using shared store or replication. The new backup server

      <title>Scaling Down</title>
      <para>An alternative to using Live/Backup groups is to configure scaledown. when configured for scale down a server
      can copy all its messages and transaction state to another live server. The advantage of this is that you dont need
      full backups to provide some form of HA, however there are disadvantages with this approach the first being that it
         only deals with a server being stopped and not a server crash. The caveat here is if you configure a backup to scale down. </para>
      <para>Another disadvantage is that it is possible to lose message ordering. This happens in the following scenario,
      say you have 2 live servers and messages are distributed evenly between the servers from a single producer, if one
         of the servers scales down then the messages sent back to the other server will be in the queue after the ones
         already there, so server 1 could have messages 1,3,5,7,9 and server 2 would have 2,4,6,8,10, if server 2 scales
         down the order in server 1 would be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10.</para>
      <graphic fileref="images/ha-scaledown.png" align="center"/>
      <para>The configuration for a live server to scale down would be something like:</para>
      <programlisting>
&lt;ha-policy>
   &lt;live-only>
      &lt;scale-down>
         &lt;connectors>
            &lt;connector-ref>server1-connector&lt;/connector-ref>
         &lt;/connectors>
      &lt;/scale-down>
   &lt;/live-only>
&lt;/ha-policy>
      </programlisting>
      <para>In this instance the server is configured to use a specific connector to scale down, if a connector is not
         specified then the first INVM connector is chosen, this is to make scale down fromm a backup server easy to configure.
         It is also possible to use discovery to scale down, this would look like:</para>
      <programlisting>
&lt;ha-policy>
   &lt;live-only>
      &lt;scale-down>
         &lt;discovery-group>my-discovery-group&lt;/discovery-group>
      &lt;/scale-down>
   &lt;/live-only>
&lt;/ha-policy>
      </programlisting>
      <section id="ha.scaledown.group">
         <title>Scale Down with groups</title>
         <para>It is also possible to configure servers to only scale down to servers that belong in the same group. This
         is done by configuring the group like so:</para>
         <programlisting>
&lt;ha-policy>
   &lt;live-only>
      &lt;scale-down>
         ...
         &lt;group-name>my-group&lt;/group-name>

      <section>
         <title>Scale Down and Backups</title>
         <para>It is also possible to mix scale down with HA via backup servers. If a slave is configured to scale down
         then after failover has occurred, instead of starting fully the backup server will immediately scale down to
         another live server. The most appropriate configuration for this is using the <literal>colocated</literal> approach.
         it means as you bring up live server they will automatically be backed up by server and as live servers are
         shutdown, there messages are made available on another live server. A typical configuration would look like:</para>
         <programlisting>
&lt;ha-policy>
   &lt;replication>
      &lt;colocated>
         &lt;backup-request-retries>44&lt;/backup-request-retries>

      <title>Scale Down and Clients</title>
      <para>When a server is stopping and preparing to scale down it will send a message to all its clients informing them
      which server it is scaling down to before disconnecting them. At this point the client will reconnect however this
      will only succeed once the server has completed scaledown. This is to ensure that any state such as queues or transactions
      are there for the client when it reconnects. The normal reconnect settings apply when the client is reconnecting so
      these should be high enough to deal with the time needed to scale down.</para>

    <section id="failover">
        <title>Failover Modes</title>
        <para>HornetQ defines two types of client failover:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Automatic client failover</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Application-level client failover</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>HornetQ also provides 100% transparent automatic reattachment of connections to the
            same server (e.g. in case of transient network problems). This is similar to failover,
            except it is reconnecting to the same server and is discussed in
            <xref linkend="client-reconnection"/></para>
        <para>During failover, if the client has consumers on any non persistent or temporary
            queues, those queues will be automatically recreated during failover on the backup node,
            since the backup node will not have any knowledge of non persistent queues.</para>
        <section id="ha.automatic.failover">
            <title>Automatic Client Failover</title>
            <para>HornetQ clients can be configured to receive knowledge of all live and backup servers, so
                that in event of connection failure at the client - live server connection, the
                client will detect this and reconnect to the backup server. The backup server will
                then automatically recreate any sessions and consumers that existed on each
                connection before failover, thus saving the user from having to hand-code manual
                reconnection logic.</para>
            <para>HornetQ clients detect connection failure when it has not received packets from
                the server within the time given by <literal>client-failure-check-period</literal>
                as explained in section <xref linkend="connection-ttl"/>. If the client does not
                receive data in good time, it will assume the connection has failed and attempt
                failover. Also if the socket is closed by the OS, usually if the server process is
                killed rather than the machine itself crashing, then the client will failover straight away.
                </para>
            <para>HornetQ clients can be configured to discover the list of live-backup server groups in a
                number of different ways. They can be configured explicitly or probably the most
                common way of doing this is to use <emphasis>server discovery</emphasis> for the
                client to automatically discover the list. For full details on how to configure
                server discovery, please see <xref linkend="clusters"/>.
                Alternatively, the clients can explicitly connect to a specific server and download
                the current servers and backups see <xref linkend="clusters"/>.</para>
            <para>To enable automatic client failover, the client must be configured to allow
                non-zero reconnection attempts (as explained in <xref linkend="client-reconnection"
                />).</para>
            <para>By default failover will only occur after at least one connection has been made to
                the live server. In other words, by default, failover will not occur if the client
                fails to make an initial connection to the live server - in this case it will simply
                retry connecting to the live server according to the reconnect-attempts property and
                fail after this number of attempts.</para>

                <para>
                    Since the client does not learn about the full topology until after the first
                    connection is made there is a window where it does not know about the backup. If a failure happens at
                    this point the client can only try reconnecting to the original live server. To configure
                    how many attempts the client will make you can set the property <literal>initialConnectAttempts</literal>
                    on the <literal>ClientSessionFactoryImpl</literal> or <literal >HornetQConnectionFactory</literal> or
                    <literal>initial-connect-attempts</literal> in xml. The default for this is <literal>0</literal>, that
                    is try only once. Once the number of attempts has been made an exception will be thrown.

                <para>HornetQ does not replicate full server state between live and backup servers.
                    When the new session is automatically recreated on the backup it won't have any
                    knowledge of messages already sent or acknowledged in that session. Any
                    in-flight sends or acknowledgements at the time of failover might also be
                    lost.</para>
                <para>By replicating full server state, theoretically we could provide a 100%
                    transparent seamless failover, which would avoid any lost messages or
                    acknowledgements, however this comes at a great cost: replicating the full
                    server state (including the queues, session, etc.). This would require
                    replication of the entire server state machine; every operation on the live
                    server would have to replicated on the replica server(s) in the exact same
                    global order to ensure a consistent replica state. This is extremely hard to do
                    in a performant and scalable way, especially when one considers that multiple
                    threads are changing the live server state concurrently.</para>
                <para>It is possible to provide full state machine replication using techniques such
                    as <emphasis role="italic">virtual synchrony</emphasis>, but this does not scale
                    well and effectively serializes all operations to a single thread, dramatically

                <para>Other techniques for multi-threaded active replication exist such as
                    replicating lock states or replicating thread scheduling but this is very hard

                <para>Consequently it has decided it was not worth massively reducing performance
                    and concurrency for the sake of 100% transparent failover. Even without 100%
                    transparent failover, it is simple to guarantee <emphasis role="italic">once and
                        only once</emphasis> delivery, even in the case of failure, by using a
                    combination of duplicate detection and retrying of transactions. However this is
                    not 100% transparent to the client code.</para>

            <title>Getting Notified of Connection Failure</title>
            <para>JMS provides a standard mechanism for getting notified asynchronously of
                connection failure: <literal>java.jms.ExceptionListener</literal>. Please consult
                the JMS javadoc or any good JMS tutorial for more information on how to use
                this.</para>
            <para>The HornetQ core API also provides a similar feature in the form of the class

                reconnected or reattached, however you can find out if reconnect or reattach has happened
            by either the <literal>failedOver</literal> flag passed in on the <literal>connectionFailed</literal>

            <title>Application-Level Failover</title>
            <para>In some cases you may not want automatic client failover, and prefer to handle any
                connection failure yourself, and code your own manually reconnection logic in your
                own failure handler. We define this as <emphasis>application-level</emphasis>
                failover, since the failover is handled at the user application level.</para>
            <para>To implement application-level failover, if you're using JMS then you need to set
                an <literal>ExceptionListener</literal> class on the JMS connection. The
                <literal>ExceptionListener</literal> will be called by HornetQ in the event that
                connection failure is detected. In your <literal>ExceptionListener</literal>, you
                would close your old JMS connections, potentially look up new connection factory
                instances from JNDI and creating new connections. In this case you may well be using
                <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossHAJNDIImpl">HA-JNDI</ulink>
                to ensure that the new connection factory is looked up from a different server.</para>
            <para>For a working example of application-level failover, please see
                <xref linkend="application-level-failover"/>.</para>
            <para>If you are using the core API, then the procedure is very similar: you would set a
                    <literal>FailureListener</literal> on the core <literal>ClientSession</literal>
                instances.</para>
