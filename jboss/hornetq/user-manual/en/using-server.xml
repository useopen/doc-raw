<chapter id="using-server">
    <title>Using the Server</title>
    <para>This chapter will familiarise you with how to use the HornetQ server.</para>
    <para>We'll show where it is, how to start and stop it, and we'll describe the directory layout
        and what all the files are and what they do.</para>
    <para>For the remainder of this chapter when we talk about the HornetQ server we mean the
        HornetQ standalone server, in its default configuration with a JMS Service and JNDI service
        enabled.</para>
    <para>When running embedded in JBoss Application Server the layout may be slightly different but
        by-and-large will be the same.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Starting and Stopping the standalone server</title>
        <para>In the distribution you will find a directory called <literal>bin</literal>.</para>
        <para><literal>cd</literal> into that directory and you will find a Unix/Linux script called
                <literal>hornetq</literal> and a Windows script called <literal>hornetq.cmd</literal>.</para>
        <para>To start the HornetQ instance on Unix/Linux type <literal>./hornetq run</literal></para>
        <para>To start the HornetQ instance on Windows type <literal>hornetq.cmd run</literal></para>
        <para>These scripts are very simple and basically just set-up the classpath and some JVM
            parameters and bootstrap the server using <ulink
                   url="https://github.com/airlift/airline">Airline</ulink>.</para>
        <para>To stop the HornetQ instance you will use the same <literal>hornetq</literal> script.</para>
        <para>To run on Unix/Linux type <literal>./hornetq stop</literal></para>
        <para>To run on Windows type <literal>hornetq.cmd stop</literal></para>
        <para>Please note that HornetQ requires a Java 6 or later runtime to run.</para>
        <para>By default the <literal>config/non-clustered/bootstrap.xml</literal> configuration is used. The
            configuration can be changed e.g. by running
            <literal>./hornetq run -- xml:../config/clustered/bootstrap.xml</literal> or another config of
            your choosing.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Server JVM settings</title>
        <para>The run scripts set some JVM settings for tuning the garbage collection policy
            and heap size. We recommend using a parallel garbage collection algorithm to smooth
            out latency and minimise large GC pauses.</para>
        <para>By default HornetQ runs in a maximum of 1GiB of RAM. To increase the memory settings
            change the <literal>-Xms</literal> and <literal>-Xmx</literal> memory settings as you
            would for any Java program.</para>
        <para>If you wish to add any more JVM arguments or tune the existing ones, the run scripts
            are the place to do it.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Pre-configured Options</title>
        <para>The distribution contains several standard configuration sets for running:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Non clustered stand-alone.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Clustered stand-alone</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Replicated stand-alone</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Shared-store stand-alone</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>You can of course create your own configuration and specify any configuration
            when running the run script.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="using-server.library.path">
        <title>Library Path</title>
        <para>If you're using the <link linkend="aio-journal">Asynchronous IO Journal</link> on
            Linux, you need to specify <literal>java.library.path</literal> as a property on your
            Java options. This is done automatically in the scripts.</para>
        <para>If you don't specify <literal>java.library.path</literal> at your Java options then
            the JVM will use the environment variable <literal>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</literal>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>System properties</title>
        <para>HornetQ can take a system property on the command line for configuring logging.</para>
        <para>For more information on configuring logging, please see <xref linkend="logging"
            />.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="using-server.configuration">
        <title>Configuration files</title>
        <para>The configuration file used to bootstrap the server (e.g. <literal>bootstrap.xml</literal>
            by default) references the specific broker configuration files.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. This is the main HornetQ
                    configuration file. All the parameters in this file are described in <xref
                        linkend="configuration-index"/>. Please see <xref
                        linkend="usingserver.mainconfig"/> for more information on this file.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><literal>hornetq-queues.xml</literal>. This file contains predefined queues,
                    queue settings and security settings. The file is optional - all this
                    configuration can also live in <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. In
                    fact, the default configuration sets do not have a <literal
                        >hornetq-queues.xml</literal> file. The purpose of allowing queues to be
                    configured in these files is to allow you to manage your queue configuration
                    over many files instead of being forced to maintain it in a single file. There
                    can be many <literal>hornetq-queues.xml</literal> files on the classpath. All
                    will be loaded if found.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><literal>hornetq-users.xml</literal> HornetQ ships with a basic security
                    manager implementation which obtains user credentials from the <literal
                        >hornetq-users.xml</literal> file. This file contains user, password and
                    role information. For more information on security, please see <xref
                        linkend="security"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><literal>hornetq-jms.xml</literal> The distro configuration by default
                    includes a server side JMS service which mainly deploys JMS Queues, Topics and
                    ConnectionFactorys from this file into JNDI. If you're not using JMS, or you
                    don't need to deploy JMS objects on the server side, then you don't need this
                    file. For more information on using JMS, please see <xref linkend="using-jms"
                    />.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <note>
            <para>The property <literal>file-deployment-enabled</literal> in the <literal
                    >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> configuration when set to false means that
                the other configuration files are not loaded. This is true by default.</para>
        </note>
        <para>It is also possible to use system property substitution in all the configuration
            files. by replacing a value with the name of a system property. Here is an example of
            this with a connector configuration:</para>
        <programlisting>
&lt;connector name="netty">
   &lt;factory-class>org.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyConnectorFactory&lt;/factory-class>
   &lt;param key="host" value="${hornetq.remoting.netty.host:localhost}"/>
   &lt;param key="port" value="${hornetq.remoting.netty.port:5445}"/>
&lt;/connector></programlisting>
        <para>Here you can see we have replaced 2 values with system properties <literal
                >hornetq.remoting.netty.host</literal> and <literal
                >hornetq.remoting.netty.port</literal>. These values will be replaced by the value
            found in the system property if there is one, if not they default back to localhost or
            5445 respectively. It is also possible to not supply a default. i.e. <literal
                >${hornetq.remoting.netty.host}</literal>, however the system property
                <emphasis>must</emphasis> be supplied in that case.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="server.bootstrap.configuration">
        <title>Bootstrap File</title>
        <para>The stand-alone server is basically a set of POJOs which are instantiated by Airline commands.</para>
        <para>The bootstrap file is very simple.  Let's take a look at an example:</para>
        <para>
            <programlisting>
&lt;broker xmlns="http://hornetq.org/schema">

   &lt;file:core configuration="${hornetq.home}/config/stand-alone/non-clustered/hornetq-configuration.xml">&lt;/core>
   &lt;file:jms configuration="${hornetq.home}/config/stand-alone/non-clustered/hornetq-jms.xml">&lt;/jms>

   &lt;basic-security/>

   &lt;naming bindAddress="localhost" port="1099" rmiBindAddress="localhost" rmiPort="1098"/>

&lt;/broker></programlisting>
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>core</para>
                <para>Instantiates a core server using the configuration file from the
                   <literal>configuration</literal> attribute. This is the main broker POJO necessary
                   to do all the real messaging work.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem id="jms">
                <para>jms</para>
                <para>This deploys any JMS Objects such as JMS Queues, Topics and ConnectionFactory
                    instances from the <literal>hornetq-jms.xml</literal> file specified. It also
                    provides a simple management API for manipulating JMS Objects. On the whole it
                    just translates and delegates its work to the core server. If you don't need to
                    deploy JMS Queues, Topics and ConnectionFactories from server side configuration
                    and don't require the JMS management interface this can be disabled.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>naming</para>

    </section>
    <section id="usingserver.mainconfig">
        <title>The main configuration file.</title>
        <para>The configuration for the HornetQ core server is contained in <literal
                >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. This is what the FileConfiguration bean uses
            to configure the messaging server.</para>
        <para>There are many attributes which you can configure HornetQ. In most cases the defaults
            will do fine, in fact every attribute can be defaulted which means a file with a single
            empty <literal>configuration</literal> element is a valid configuration file. The
            different configuration will be explained throughout the manual or you can refer to the
